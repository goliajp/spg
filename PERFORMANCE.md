# Performance — what's measured, what's not

SPG's positioning is "modern Rust implementation of an embedded
SQL+vector store, performance-first". For that to mean anything, every
number that appears in a commit message, README, or release note **must
trace back to a measurement that anyone can reproduce.** Guesses don't
count. Estimates don't count. Numbers we'd like to be true don't count.

This file is the source of truth for which SPG perf claims are honestly
measured and which are still open. When in doubt, default to the latest
column ("Measured?") here — not to whatever a commit message or marketing
material says.

The work is organised stone-by-stone. A *stone* in SPG is a workspace
crate (eight of them; see `Cargo.toml`). Each stone owns its own
`benches/`, `BUDGETS.md`, and `tests/perf_gate.rs`; the workspace owns
this `PERFORMANCE.md` as the rolled-up index.

## Methodology

- **Run criterion in release**: `cargo bench -p <stone> --bench <name>`.
  The workspace's `[profile.release]` is fully tuned (LTO=fat,
  codegen-units=1, panic=abort, strip=symbols) — there's no separate
  `release-perf` profile because the regular `release` already is one.
- **Quote the median** from criterion's own output. The 95% CI sits
  next to it; if a "−X% / Y×" claim shrinks once you account for the
  CI, the claim is wrong and the table must say so.
- **Run perf gates in test**: `cargo test --release --test perf_gate`
  per stone. Gates have ~10× headroom by design — they catch
  order-of-magnitude regressions, not micro-perf swings. Don't quote
  them as perf claims; quote the criterion bench medians instead.
- **End-to-end baseline**: `time cargo run -q -p sqllogictest --release`
  exercises lex + parse + execute + result-format over all 369 corpus
  records. It's the integration metric — useful sanity check, not a
  fine-grained measurement.

## Workspace-level

| Path | Measurement | Run command |
|---|---|---|
| sqllogictest full suite wall-time, release | **~1.57 s** for 369 records across 4 corpora (M-series Mac, 2026-05-26 baseline). Cached release build; pure runtime. | `time cargo run -q -p sqllogictest --release` |

## Per-stone baseline (v3.0.0, 2026-05-26)

All numbers below are first-ever-measured baselines at the v3.0.0 perf
kickoff. Future rows go *above* the baseline with a date stamp and the
commit SHA, so a stone's history reads top-down = newest-to-oldest.

### `spg-wire` — wire protocol encode/decode

| Path                                | Median   | Notes |
|-------------------------------------|---------:|-------|
| `query_encode_decode_roundtrip`     | **47 ns** | Build → encode → decode → parse for `SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = 42`. |
| `row_description_3col_roundtrip`    | **154 ns**| 3-column (Int / Text / Float) schema header. |
| `data_row_3col_roundtrip`           | **121 ns**| One row with `(Int(42), Text("alice"), Float(95.5))`. |

Run: `cargo bench -p spg-wire --bench frames`.

### `spg-sql` — lexer + parser

| Path                                | Median   | Notes |
|-------------------------------------|---------:|-------|
| `lex_select_one`                    | **42 ns** | Tokenize `SELECT 1`. |
| `parse_select_one`                  | **135 ns**| Full parse of `SELECT 1`. |
| `parse_select_where_order_limit`    | **666 ns**| `SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id > 100 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10`. |
| `parse_join_aggregate`              | **1.45 µs** | Multi-table JOIN + GROUP BY + HAVING + ORDER BY <int> + LIMIT. |

Run: `cargo bench -p spg-sql --bench parse`.

### `spg-storage` — catalog round-trip + HNSW

| Path                                | Median   | Notes |
|-------------------------------------|---------:|-------|
| `catalog_serialize_100rows`         | **1.15 µs** | 100-row, 3-col (Int / Text / Float) table → bytes. |
| `catalog_deserialize_100rows`       | **4.15 µs** | Same bytes → Catalog. Deserialize is ~4× slower than serialize. |
| `hnsw_build_200rows_dim8`           | **154 µs** | v3.0.1: was 2.41 ms; **−94% / 15.7×** ✅. Heuristic neighbour selection (HNSW paper §4) + `BinaryHeap` frontier + bitmap visited set. |
| `hnsw_search_top10_dim8_n200`       | **397 ns** | v3.0.1: was 4.75 µs; **−92% / 12×** ✅. Bonus from the same data-structure swap (search shares `layer_beam_search`). |

Run: `cargo bench -p spg-storage --bench catalog`.

### `spg-crypto` — BLAKE3 content hash (single-thread reference)

| Path        | Median       | Notes |
|-------------|-------------:|-------|
| `hash_64b`  | **67 ns**    | Single BLAKE3 block. |
| `hash_1kib` | **1.14 µs**  | Single chunk; ~900 MB/s. |
| `hash_16kib`| **19.5 µs**  | 16 chunks; ~840 MB/s. |

Run: `cargo bench -p spg-crypto --bench hash`.

### `spg-audit` — append-only log + hash-chain verify

| Path                       | Median       | Notes |
|----------------------------|-------------:|-------|
| `append_one`               | **189 ns**   | One AuditEntry append, prev-hash lookup → BLAKE3 → push. |
| `verify_100entries`        | **8.94 µs**  | Full hash-chain walk; ~89 ns/entry. |
| `serialize_100entries`     | **413 ns**   | Whole log → bytes. |

Run: `cargo bench -p spg-audit --bench log`.

### `spg-engine` — query execution (end-to-end SQL → QueryResult)

| Path                                | Median       | Notes |
|-------------------------------------|-------------:|-------|
| `execute_select_const`              | **255 ns**   | `SELECT 1`; parser-dominated. |
| `execute_select_where_n100`         | **2.57 µs**  | `SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = 42` against a 100-row table. |
| `execute_select_count_group_n100`   | **3.33 µs**  | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE id < 50` (filter + aggregate). |
| `execute_insert_one`                | **2.60 µs**  | Single-row INSERT into a 100-row table (re-creates the table per iter via `iter_batched`). |

Run: `cargo bench -p spg-engine --bench execute`.

### `spg-server` — TCP request/response path

Server perf is covered transitively by `spg-wire` + `spg-engine` +
`spg-storage` benches; no direct stone-level bench in v3.0.0. The
end-to-end metric for server-flavoured load is the `sqllogictest`
wall-time row at the top.

### `spg-cli` — backup / restore path

| Path                                | Median        | Notes |
|-------------------------------------|--------------:|-------|
| `backup_roundtrip_100rows`          | **~12 ms**    | Full read+deserialize+serialize+write loop, including disk syscalls. High variance (5–22 ms across runs) — disk I/O dominates; on-machine number, not portable. |

Run: `cargo bench -p spg-cli --bench backup`.

## Perf gates

Each crate's `tests/perf_gate.rs` runs as part of `cargo test --release
--test perf_gate`. Budgets live in that crate's `BUDGETS.md`.
Order-of-magnitude headroom by design — these are not publishable
numbers.

| Crate        | Run command                                                | Gate count |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------:|
| spg-wire     | `cargo test --release -p spg-wire     --test perf_gate`   | 1 |
| spg-sql      | `cargo test --release -p spg-sql      --test perf_gate`   | 1 |
| spg-storage  | `cargo test --release -p spg-storage  --test perf_gate`   | 2 |
| spg-crypto   | `cargo test --release -p spg-crypto   --test perf_gate`   | 2 |
| spg-audit    | `cargo test --release -p spg-audit    --test perf_gate`   | 1 |
| spg-engine   | `cargo test --release -p spg-engine   --test perf_gate`   | 1 |
| spg-cli      | `cargo test --release -p spg-cli      --test perf_gate`   | 1 |

(`spg-server` is a binary and runs no `perf_gate.rs`; its hot paths are
covered by the upstream stones.)
